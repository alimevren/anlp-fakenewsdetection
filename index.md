## ANLP Fake News Detection Project

In the recent years, if we had to mention a trending term for the field of communication, this wouldbe undoubtedly fake news. This has been provoked and pushed given the worldwide surge of socialmedia, which has meant new ways to share news to friends and followers. This term refers to news that contain purposely false information, which causes a negative impacton both readers and society as a whole. Considering this, it’s no surprise that different projects and companies such as Newscheck, Newtralor Factmata have aroused to tackle this problem.  These try to find and detect news with deceptivewords  which  make  online  users  infected  and  deceived  from  this  false  information.   For  Natural Language Processing, this means a extremely promising field of research, as not only the words but also the sentence build-up influence how readers assume the information. Despite the amount of attention this topic has received in the last few years, it wasn’t very accessible to  find  fake  news  data  sets  that  ease  the  task  until  recently.   Another  big  point  for  fake  news detection is that the conception on perceiving whether news are real or fake, sentiments play a bigrole within.  Sources are also relevant, since it’s relatively frequent that they have a target audience,causing a change on how these news are perceived, depending on who is reading them.  Thus, fakenews detectors aren’t still a widespread tool for internet users and makes this task a multi-factorial problem. In our project, a model will be trained to distinguish real news from fake news.  Additionally, datasets with the inclusion of satirical news and headlines from the onion and actual news that sound satirical from r/NotTheOnion(page within the website Reddit) will be added to find whether the implemented model is able to differentiate between these two types of news. This last field of work has gotten less attention than simply fake news detection.  With this addition, it is intended to innovate with respect to already existing models.
